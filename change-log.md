##Version 1.0.2

modal.snippet: Removed button to launch modal. Most of the time I just need the modal code without a button to launch it. Also added additional declarations for close-text and save-text.

##Version 1.0.1

Small fix for accordion.snippet to make sure that the data-parent attribute is set to the id that is set as part of the snippet.

##Version 1.0

Initial version
